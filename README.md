PalMon is stealing Pokemon data (please don't sue)

## Features

- üîÑ Automatic Pokemon data scraping from PokeAPI
- üöÄ Fast and modern REST API
- üìä Prometheus metrics integration
- üìù OpenAPI documentation
- üß™ Comprehensive test suite
- üîß Nix-based development environment

## Quick Start

You can easily run the project with the provided script. It has two modes:

1. with Nix
2. with Docker

### Running with Just Nix

You can run run-palmon.sh that will detect if you have Nix installed and use it. Or if you don't have Nix installed, it will install it for you. Please consider the warning below below before running the script.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Running `run-palmon.sh` will:
- ‚ò†‚ò† Install Nix package manager on your system ‚ò†‚ò†
- Modify your shell configuration
- Add Nix configuration files
Make sure you understand these changes before proceeding!

If you're okay with these changes: 

```
./run-palmon.sh
```

This will:
1. Install Nix if not present
2. Set up the development environment
3. Scrape Pokemon data
4. Start the API server
5. Run smoke tests

## Running with Docker

For those who don't want to deal with Nix, you can use the provided script to run the project in a Docker container.
This assumes you have Docker installed on your system. So if you don't have it, you can install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```
./run-palmon-docker.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the Docker image
2. Run the container interactively
3. Execute `run-palmon.sh` inside the container

## Manual Setup

If you already have a Python environment and the `uv` package manager, you can manually set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ardfard/PalMon.git
   cd PalMon
   ```

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

1. ** change directory to src or add src to PYTHONPATH** :
   ```bash
   cd src

   # or

   export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH"
   ```

1. **Run the scraper**:
   ```bash
   python -m palmon.scraper.pokemon_scraper
   ```

1. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   python -m palmon.api.app
   ```

1. **Run smoke tests**:
   ```bash
   ./smoke_test.sh
 
   ```

## API Documentation

Once running, API documentation is available at:
- OpenAPI UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/pokemon`: List all Pokemon with pagination
- `GET /api/pokemon/{id}`: Get specific Pokemon by ID
- `GET /metrics`: Prometheus metrics

## Configuration

The Pokemon scraper can be configured using environment variables to control:
- The number of Pokemon to scrape
- The level of concurrency for scraping tasks

### Configuration Options

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following options:

* `POKEMON_SCRAPER_LIMIT`: Controls how many Pokemon to scrape (1 to 1008)
* `POKEMON_SCRAPER_CONCURRENCY`: Controls how many concurrent requests to make (recommended: 5-20)

Example:

```env
POKEMON_SCRAPER_LIMIT=151

POKEMON_SCRAPER_CONCURRENCY=10
```

- `POKEMON_SCRAPER_LIMIT`: Controls how many Pokemon to scrape. The scraping will happens sequentially from id 1 until the limit is reached. The default value is 151 (generation 1 number of pokemon). Maximum value as of this writing is 1025.
- `POKEMON_SCRAPER_CONCURRENCY`: Controls how many concurrent requests to make. Default is 10 (recommended: 5-20).

### Performance Considerations

- Higher concurrency means faster scraping but may hit rate limits
- Recommended settings:
  - Small dataset: LIMIT=50, CONCURRENCY=5
  - Medium dataset: LIMIT=151, CONCURRENCY=10
  - Full dataset: LIMIT=1025, CONCURRENCY=20

The scraper will automatically:
- Handle rate limiting
- Retry failed requests
- Update existing Pokemon data
- Log progress to console


## Development

### Running Tests

```
./run_tests.sh
```

The project uses GitHub Actions for:
- Running tests
- Code coverage reporting
- Smoke testing
- Dependency caching
